;;;; Directory Variables
;;  We're going to define a number of directories that are used throughout this
;;  configuration to store different types of files. This is a bit like the
;;  `no-littering' package, and allows us to keep `user-emacs-directory' tidy.

  "The path to the emacs.d directory.")

This will house all setup libraries and external libraries or packages.")

Contents are subject to change. Used for package storage (elpa or
straight) and by `shl-etc-dir' and `shl-cache-dir'.")

(defconst shl-etc-dir (concat shl-var-dir "etc/")
  "The directory for non-volatile storage.
  These are not deleted or tampered with by emacs functions. Use
  this for dependencies like servers or config files that are
  stable (i.e. it should be unlikely that you need to delete them
               if something goes wrong).")

(defconst shl-cache-dir (concat shl-var-dir "cache/")
  "The directory for volatile storage.
  Use this for transient files that are generated on the fly like
  caches and ephemeral/temporary files. Anything that may need to
  be cleared if there are probshls.")
